1.*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?*

Merging and merging conflict were an issue in some of the past challenges.

2.*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?*

Pairing in general was something I hadn't really understood. Fetching vs 
Pulling was also a confusion that arose.

3.*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*

Most of the questions I asked my pair were focused on the communication
within the pair. Making sure to check in at decision points, seeing if
I was being understood.

4.*What still confuses you about Git?*

I'm pretty clear on what I know about Git, I'm sure there are plenty of
complex things I don't know but I don't know that I don't know them.

5.*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?*

Fantastic, the combination of intense focus and communication was
honestly exhilarating. It definitely felt awkward but what new thing
doesn't? It felt like video's of rally races I've seen:
