1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Before I started the session I was still shakey with the overall concept of git merge, git fetch, git push, and git pull.
2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Working with a cohort I understood git pull and git push better, and together we learned about git fetch and git merge.
3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked my guide if with git commands that capitalization matters and he said yes, that helped with a problem we were having.  
4. What still confuses you about Git?
The whole concept of pushing and pulling is still so new to me.  I understand how to use it and when to use it though.  But I guess I would like to practice it in practical situations. 
5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
My first experience with GPS was good but I felt a little unsure I wasn't sure what to ask the guide, I didn't want to ask too much to make it look like I didn't know what I was doing.  Even though I went over the material and I was confident with the material.  I kind of blanked when the session started.  I started feeling a little pressure.  But overall after a little bit I calmed down and it felt more natural.
